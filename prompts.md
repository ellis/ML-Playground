How should I run this project. When I use `pnpm build` and then `npx http-server -- .`, I can open the page at http://localhost:8080, but there is very little content. Contrast this to the working website [here](https://ml-playground.com/#).

Please use the playwright MCP server to continue investigation. Compare this version to the [original](https://ml-playground.com/).
